• Led statistical analysis and logistic regression in R on custom dataset using Spotify API/Essentia features; predicted ‘Not Like Us’ with highest probability (23%), validated by actual Grammy win

• Found that ROTY winners are longer (+27s, p=0.0037), less popular (−10 pts, p=5.6e-07), and slightly less danceable (-0.09, p=0.002)

• Summarized findings in a research paper including abstract, body, conclusion, and appendix to ensure detailed description of results
